# MAIN PLAYBOOK FOR LOCAL DEPLOYMENT MODE / ANSIBLE-PULL
#
# How to invoke on localhost, use something like this:
#
#   env-ansible
#   ansible-playbook \
#     --inventory localhost, \
#     --vault-password-file /etc/ansible/vault.pass \
#     playbooks/localhost.yml
#
# To run correctly, this playbook minimaly need these localfacts:
#
#   - ansible_local.coda19.site.id
#   - ansible_local.coda19.node.role
#
#   Those are needed to correctly load corresponding vars, vaults and which
#   meta role to load (eg: _green, _orange, etc.). They are initialized when
#   running the boostrap procedure.
#
#   To get more information about localfacts and file locations, see docs:
#   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html#facts-d-or-local-facts
#
# Then other facts can (or should) come from:
#
#   - Site vault, in file vaults/vault.<site id>
#   - Site group vars, in file group_vars/s<site id>
#
# Storing some facts in vaults and in group_vars is very useful becase we can ensure
# that they are centrally, properly managed and used independently the deployment
# strategy, being either:
#
#   - locally using ansible pull (this localhost playbook)
#   - remotely using traditionnal push over ssh (remote playbooks)
#
